chess bot using burn deep learning framework

-progress as out 7/1
- model is still being built out


after model is built out 
- after training ( hopefully < 20$ on gpu )
- will see performance 


to-do:

handle threefold repetition in bitboard.cpp, look into Zobrist Hashes of chess positions and how to calculate that easily

also implement insufficient material stalemate in @tiny-backend/tiny-ml/chess_helpers/game_logic.py
